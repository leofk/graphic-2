**Part 1**
- Note for Part C: In sphere.vs I have written three possible solutions for part c (Lines 99, 100, 101). 2 of which are commented out. Option 1 has a heart that throbs with respect to time, this is my favourite output but maybe doesnt count as a "deformation". Option 2 (uncommented) transforms the original sphere to the heart, this is a nice conceptually but looks quite ugly. Option 3 is a generic sphere to ellipsoid transformation in case the other ones don't satisfy the "deformation" question specification. 

Keybinds:
- W: Orb moves _forwards_.
- S: Orb moves _backwards_.
- A: Orb moves _left_.
- D: Orb moves _right_.
- Q: Orb moves _up_.
- E: Orb moves _down_.

**Part 2**
- cosmetic adjustments
- changed movement back to armadillo
- laser now disintigrates pulsing heart
- new one spawns in a random location
