Part 1: Solutions to Part 1 Questions.
- Note for Part C: In sphere.vs I have written three possible solutions for part c (Lines 99, 100, 101). 2 of which are commented out. Option 1 (uncommented) has a heart that throbs with respect to time, I chose this as it is the most satisfying output. Option 2 transforms the original sphere to the heart, this is a nice conceptually but looks quite ugly. Option 3 is a generic sphere to ellipsoid transformation in case the other ones don't satisfy the "deformation" question specification.
